# To-Do

 - Add ability to customize created dropet and VPN server
 - Add timer to droplet rather than having to manually destroy it
   - Add email to alert user when droplet is about to be destroyed
 - Add ability to save created dropet to a JSON or config file that will allow for later destruction or modification
